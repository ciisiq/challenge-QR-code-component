- Flexbox
- Mobile-first

### What I learned

I used all the feedback I got from my last submit and try to apply here so I learned about the landmark that I need to put and roles, the importance about to use rem in text.

```html
<main role="main">Main tag</main>
```

```css
.description {
  font-size: 0.938rem;
```

### Continued development

I need to learn more about accebility, the most feedbacks I had was about tags and for people with disability, I was not expected this but I was very happy to read and improve.

### Useful resources
